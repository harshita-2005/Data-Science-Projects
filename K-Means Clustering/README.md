**Introduction:**
This project implements K-Means clustering on a dataset containing the latest COVID-19 statistics by country. The goal is to identify clusters of countries based on various COVID-19 metrics such as confirmed cases, deaths, recovered cases, and more.

**Dataset Used:**
The project uses a CSV file containing COVID-19 data (country_wise_latest.csv).

**Libraries Used:**
pandas for data manipulation
matplotlib for visualization
numpy for numerical operations
sklearn for K-Means clustering and silhouette scoring

**Output:**
A scatter plot showing the distribution of countries based on confirmed cases and deaths.
The silhouette scores for different cluster counts to help determine the best number of clusters.
A final scatter plot visualizing the clusters and their centroids.

**Conclusion:**
This project demonstrates the use of K-Means clustering to analyze COVID-19 data. By identifying clusters, we can better understand how different countries are affected by the pandemic and make more informed decisions based on the data.
