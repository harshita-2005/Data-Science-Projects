**Introduction**
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about genetic disorders. The dataset is analyzed to uncover insights regarding the prevalence of genetic disorders, the demographics of affected individuals, and specific details about disorder subclasses.

**Dataset Overview**
Dataset: train_genetic_disorders.csv
Total Patients: 16,907
Features: 45 columns including patient demographics, test results, genetic disorders, and more.

**Libraries Used**
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
numpy: For numerical operations
matplotlib: For data visualization

**Key Findings**
. The analysis showed different genetic disorders affect various age groups in unique ways.
. There were noticeable differences in test results based on the type of genetic disorder.
. Some genetic disorders were more common in one gender than the other, indicating a need for more research.
. found links between age and certain test results, which could help identify risk factors.

**Conclusion**
The exploratory data analysis allowed for a diverse examination of the dataset through random questions. This approach facilitated the discovery of valuable insights into genetic disorders, underscoring the importance of EDA in understanding complex datasets.
