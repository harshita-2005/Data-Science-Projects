# Data Science Projects

Welcome to the Data Science Projects Repository! This collection showcases a variety of data science techniques, demonstrating hands-on implementations in different domains.

## Projects Overview

### 1. K-Means Clustering
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm to group similar data points. It includes data visualization to illustrate the clusters and their characteristics, helping to identify patterns within datasets.

### 2. Linear Regression
This project showcases a linear regression model to predict continuous outcomes based on input features. It covers data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation, providing insights into the relationships between variables.

### 3. OpenCV Checkerboard Pattern
In this project, a checkerboard pattern is generated using OpenCV and NumPy. Users can specify the dimensions of the checkerboard, and the program creates a corresponding image, illustrating basic image processing techniques.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis to uncover insights from datasets. It utilizes data visualization techniques to summarize data and highlight key findings, providing a foundation for further analysis.
