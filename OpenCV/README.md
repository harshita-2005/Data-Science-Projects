Creating a 8*8 Checkerboard using OpenCV

**Introduction:**
This project demonstrates how to create a checkerboard pattern of 8*8 dimensions using the OpenCV library in Python. The checkerboard consists of alternating white and black squares arranged in a grid.


**Requirements:**
Python 3.x
OpenCV library
NumPy library

**Explanation:**
Import Libraries:  The script imports the OpenCV library for image processing and NumPy for numerical operations.
Create Image:  A black image of size 400x400 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB) is created.

**Output:**
Two nested loops are used to fill squares with white color (255, 255, 255) to create the checkerboard pattern.
Save and Display Image: The generated checkerboard image is saved as checkerboard_output.png and displayed in a window.
